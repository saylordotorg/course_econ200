**Unit 3: Financial Theory, Risk, and Applications** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Financial theory is predicated on the concept of inflation, or the
general rise in prices over time.  Inflation has the power to erode
people’s savings or erase their debts.  The rate of inflation varies
over time, and its effects must be factored into a variety of
quantitative economic models.  In this unit, we will calculate the real
value of a currency in two different ways and select which is best for
various models.  
  
 Risk is a measurable phenomenon.  Every time a decision is made, there
is a risk that the expected outcome will not be the actual result.  In
this respect, risk is ever-present because our environment is
continually changing.  The fairness of a system can be characterized by
a risk and reward calculation, and models of risk tolerance can quantify
an individual’s or firm’s appetite for risk.  
  
 Arbitrage is a typical example of a risk application.  Generally
defined as exploiting price differentials by buying a financial asset in
one market and selling it in another, arbitrage involves calculating
risk and reward.  Economists will evaluate the similarities and
differences in assets and markets over time to arrive at an optimal and
potentially risk-free transaction.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Develop a toolkit of quantitative methods to solve problems in
    financial theory and risk.
-   Apply specific quantitative tools (expected value, probabilities,
    and algebraic equations) to solve problems in financial theory and
    risk.
-   Analyze returns to capital over time with inflation risk,
    diversification, and probabilities from an algebraic perspective.
-   Choose between using real and nominal interest rates when building
    an economic model.
