**Unit 5: Game Theory** <span id="5"></span> 
*Game theory was first applied to economic problems by the
Nobel-Prize-winning economist John Nash.  His discoveries were
dramatized in the movie* A Beautiful Mind*.  In essence, game theory
describes and predicts how participants will make decisions based on
their expectations of consequences.  In the classic game, the prisoner’s
dilemma, two criminals either choose to confess or maintain innocence.
 There are four possible outcomes and associated benefits and costs with
each.  The choices can be quantified, and a “Nash equilibrium” can be
calculated.  Although abstract, this kind of game can describe behavior
in oligopolies.*  
  
 *Games can become substantially more complex as additional moves and
choices are incorporated into models.  Decision trees can be used to
describe sequential move games, and a payoff matrix approximates
simultaneous move games like the prisoner’s dilemma.  Algorithms will
provide some solutions to Nash equilibriums, while partial derivatives
yield answers to other games.  The right tool must be matched to each
kind of game.*  
  
 *As a practical example, game theory can be used to describe some kinds
of auctions.  This kind of market has gained increasing popularity with
the advent of online auctions at eBay.  When calculating a price, the
bidder must analyze available data, but some information is held back.
 The introduction of uncertainty into the process makes the optimal
calculations extremely complex.*
