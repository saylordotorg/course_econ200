**Unit 2: Temporal Optimization** <span id="2"></span> 
*Humans perceive their environment in four dimensions.  The first three
– length, width, and height – define our physical universe.  We can
pinpoint any location using those three coordinates.  The fourth
dimension, time, is perceived as moving linearly in one direction.
 Humans can observe how things change over time, and economists try to
explain and predict these changes using quantitative tools.*  
  
 *The relative value of an asset will change over time.  Some assets,
like gold, remain fairly unchanged, while others decay, like a wood
house.  Even when assets don’t decay, their relative value to goods and
services may change.  For example, an ounce gold coin purchased in 2006
was worth about $600 and more than doubled in value in 2010.  Present
value calculations are used to figure out how much less (or more) an
asset will be worth at a future time.  These are important calculations
for anyone saving their income.*  
  
 *How assets change over time has broader implications for whole
societies.  Economic growth models assume that investments in capital
depreciate over time, and a sustainable growth pattern requires the
correct rate of capital replacement.  While simple models may explain
growth over two periods, more dynamic ones explain changes over
generations or even whole empires.  Remember that economists try to
assist people to make optimal choices not only today but also well into
the future.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 9.50 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 2.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 4.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 3 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Develop a toolkit of quantitative methods to solve optimization
    problems over time in macroeconomics and microeconomics.
-   Apply specific quantitative tools (present value calculations,
    organic growth equations, derivatives) to solve problems in
    macroeconomics and microeconomics.
-   Analyze returns to capital over time, economic growth, and period
    models from an algebraic and calculus perspective and interpret the
    differences between tools.
