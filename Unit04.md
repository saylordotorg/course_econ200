**Unit 4: Equitable Division of Resources and Consumption** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Economics is sometimes classified as the science of scarcity.
 Everything in our universe is scarce.  There is only so much fresh
water, food, and energy on the planet.  Because we are mortal, our time
is scarce, and even intangible things like good ideas are not in
infinite supply.  Economists can quantify this scarcity to help
individuals, companies, and governments make the optimal choices about
how to divide our resources.*  
  
 *Exactly how to divide up resources has been a constant debate since
ancient times.  Economists can view the problem on a very personal
level, like how best to divide up a pizza pie among a group of children,
or on a global scale, like assessing fishing rights in international
waters.  There is no one right way to measure fairness, and context must
be considered.  Nevertheless, the essential fairness of a decision can
be measured using objective mathematical tools.*  
  
 *Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto was an Italian economist who spent
much of his life measuring efficiency and fairness.  He successfully
quantified trade theories and distribution patterns of wealth in
nations.  Jeremy Bentham proposed a calculation system for pleasure and
suffering to calculate “the greatest good for the greatest number.” 
Individuals can use a cost-benefit analysis to make better decisions
about the allocation decisions they face.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 8.75 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 1.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 2.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 4.5 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Develop a toolkit of quantitative methods to solve problems in
    resource allocation and product consumption.
-   Apply specific quantitative tools (cost-benefit analysis) to solve
    problems in choice theory.
-   Analyze differences in equity and fairness using economic
    definitions and tools.
-   Evaluate the optimal equity solution within the broader context of
    economic theory and practical applications.
