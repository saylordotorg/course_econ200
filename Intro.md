Math for Economists will help you assemble a toolkit of skills and
techniques to solve fundamental problems in both macroeconomics and
microeconomics.  The material covers both precalculus and calculus
concepts and should help you identify the best approach to solving
problems.  For example, an economist may be called upon to determine the
right mix allocation of capital to a production process.  The tools in
this course will help you evaluate the options and select from the best
alternatives.  Advanced courses in economics typically utilize
mathematical techniques beyond basic calculus; so, gaining practice in
fundamental skills can serve as a good basis for further study.  Of
note, this course applies precalculus and calculus; this is different
from “applied math,” which economists typically use to refer to
probability and statistics. This course begins with a survey of basic
optimization tools and then applies them to solve problems over several
periods in time.  These optimization tools describe feasible choices and
then direct you to the best possible solution.  In essence, they will
help you evaluate an economic environment and determine the best course
of action.  The role of risk in financial decisions is explored in
relation to individual choices and macroeconomic processes.  The
equitable distribution of resources is then considered.  In other words,
this class will explore whether an optimal solution is indeed also fair
to the participants and society.  A specific application, game theory,
is presented as one of the major recent advances in economic theory.
 The final topic returns to microeconomic problems such as taxes,
elasticity, and specific types of supply and demand curves. The
materials included in the course offer a framework that you can use to
apply quantitative skills.  You should liberally use Saylor course
materials ([MA001](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma001/),
[MA003](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma003/),
[MA005](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma005/),
[ECON103/MA101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ103/),
and [MA102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma102/)) to refresh their
general techniques.  This course fits into the major as a bridge between
quantitative theory and specific applications to problems in economics.
 Completing this course can greatly help students successfully build a
toolkit for the intermediate courses,
[ECON201](http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ201/) and
[ECON202](http://www.saylor.org/courses/econ202/).

### Course Information

Welcome to ECON200: Math for Economists. General information about this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [Professor Tony
Pizur](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorTonyPizur)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   YouTube: Yale University, Department of Economics
    [Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/user/YaleCourses?feature=watch)
-   Yoram Bauman’s [Quantum Microeconomics with
    Calculus](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ECON001_Bauman.pdf),
    Version 4.02
-   Khan Academy [“Economics
    Videos”](http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy?feature=watch)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned material.
All units build on previous units, so it will be important to progress
through the course in the order presented. You will also need to
complete:

-   Unit 1 Self-Test
-   Unit 2 Self-Test
-   Unit 3 Self-Test
-   Unit 4 Self-Test
-   Unit 5 Self-Test
-   Unit 6 Self-Test

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessments in this course.   
  
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.   
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately 84.25 hours to complete. Each unit includes a time
advisory that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each
subunit and assignment. These time advisories should help you plan your
time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at the time advisories
before beginning this course in order to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit. Then, you can set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 29
hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a total of 10.75 hours) on Monday and
Tuesday night, Subunit 1.2 (a total of 9.5 hours) on Wednesday and
Thursday night, etc.
