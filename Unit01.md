**Unit 1: Basic Tools of Optimization in Economics** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Economics can be described as the study of how individuals, firms, and
governments make the best choice among competing alternatives.
Individuals seek to maximize utility or happiness, firms want to
maximize profits, and governments attempt to maximize social well-being.
Sometimes the possible and expected consequences of a choice can be
quantified to help rank and determine the best, or optimal, selection.
Economists use a variety of quantitative tools to evaluate alternatives,
and this unit will build a foundation of basic optimization techniques.
Calculus techniques are the primary methods in an economist’s
toolkit.*  
  
 *Calculus can be used to model most marginal decisions because
derivatives measure the instantaneous rate of change. In other words,
calculus describes what happens when we change “just a little more” of
some variable in a process. Economists can then examine the whole range
of choices – considering just a little bit more and more – until all
options have been exhausted to determine the optimal one. Using advanced
calculus, economists can isolate a single variable or input so that
decisions can be broken down into their constituent components.*  
  
 *A good visual way of describing marginal choices is a decision tree.
Decision trees map a formal process of possible expected outcomes of a
decision. Their main value is identifying secondary and tertiary
consequences of a choice. The additional, or marginal, benefits and
costs at each step in the decision process can be clearly assigned. As a
measure of risk, probabilities for possible outcomes can be calculated
to help the decision maker identify the most likely scenarios.  Remember
that decision trees can be used to model almost any rational choice
process.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   develop a toolkit of quantitative methods to solve optimization
    problems in macroeconomics and microeconomics;
-   apply specific quantitative tools (decision trees, algebraic
    equations, derivatives, integrals) to solve problems in
    macroeconomics and microeconomics; and
-   analyze specific problems in microeconomics and macroeconomics from
    an algebraic and calculus perspective and interpret the similarities
    and differences among tools.
