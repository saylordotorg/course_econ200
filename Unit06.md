**Unit 6: Microeconomic Theory and Applications** <span id="6"></span> 
*Economists make many assumptions about the nature of supply and demand.
 Curves are smooth continuous functions and are nicely behaved in
Euclidean space.  A basic graphic argument can be constructed and then
extrapolated to algebra and then calculus.  In the real world, these
assumptions and mathematical extrapolations often need modification, but
it’s a good beginning point to understand how supply and demand behave
in a perfect theoretical world.  
  
 Joseph Louis Lagrange was an important mathematician in the eighteenth
century; he developed a mathematical technique to calculate minimum and
maximum points of a function.  Originally applied in physics, his work
has been used in a variety of fields, from quantum mechanics to the
general theory of relativity.  Because economists seek to maximize (or
minimize) outcomes, Lagrangian techniques are a mainstay of any economic
toolkit.  
  
 Calculus is the primary tool to calculate the instantaneous slope of a
function at a given point.  The slope reveals the rate of change and
gives insight into marginal choices a consumer or firm makes.  The
double derivative describes the rate of change of the rate of change.
 While this may sound abstract, the information indicates whether the
rate of change is increasing, decreasing, or remaining the same
intensity.  This has applications in consumer choice and profit
maximization.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Develop a toolkit of quantitative methods to solve problems in
    microeconomics.
-   Apply specific quantitative tools (algebraic techniques,
    derivatives, partial derivatives, Lagrangian techniques) to solve
    problems in consumer theory.
-   Analyze differences in supply curves, demand curves, and utility
    functions using quantitative techniques.
-   Synthesize problem solutions in taxation, elasticity, and
    optimization by combining various elements of the quantitative
    toolkit as presented throughout the course.
